# Getting started

## What is Jhaystack?
Jhaystack is a lightweight JavaScript JSON search engine.

?> The word Jhaystack is a play of words with "JS-Stack", and was coined because it `helps you find a needle in a JS-Stack`.

Jhaystack allows you to search through not just values but also objects and arrays, and fine tune your search in order to fit a variety of different use cases. Unlike most other search engines Jhaystack is not limited to evaluating strings, but can also be customized to evaluate other data types, like dates, numbers, or even regular expressions.

## Why Jhaystack?
- Modular and customizable
- Compatible with most runtime environments
- Zero dependencies
- Fast searches
- Simple to use
- No dedicated search backend needed

> ## Installation

Install using npm:

```bash
$ npm install jhaystack
```

Load using a script element:
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/jhaystack"></script>
```

!> If you load the library bundle using a script element then a global variable called Jhaystack will be created. All examples in these docs use standard ES import statements, but in this case you can omit these and instead access the necessary parts of the library by using Jhaystack.X.
```html
<script>
//No
import { Jhaystack, ComparisonStrategy } from "jhaystack"
//Yes
Jhaystack.Jhaystack
Jhaystack.ComparisonStrategy
</script>
```

!> With the commonjs build you can also use require statements like so:
```javascript
const { Jhaystack, ComparisonStrategy } = require("jhaystack")
```

> ## Using the library

Using the library in its simplest form is extremely easy:

```javascript
import { Jhaystack } from "jhaystack"

const data = [
    {
        name: "tom"
    },
    {
        name: "tim"
    }
]
const se = new Jhaystack({data: data})
const results = se.search("tm")
//[{ path: ["name"], item: { name: "tom" }, value: "tom", relevance: 0.749999995, comparisonScore: 0.49999999, comparisonIndex: 0}, { path: ["name"], item: { name: "tim" }, value: "tim", relevance: 0.749999995, comparisonScore: 0.49999999, comparisonIndex: 0 }]
```

---

> ## Results

The result of a search will be an array of objects. Each object has the item itself (.item) where a match was found, a path (.path) to where in the object the match was found, the actual value (.value) that was matched, a comparison score showing the score that the comparison function gave it (.comparisonScore), the index of the comparison function that gave the score (.comparisonIndex), and finally the relevance (.relevance) of the match.

#### Relevance

Relevance is a score of how relevant a matched result is. Jhaystack provides the relevance score in the form of a number between 0 and 1, 0 being a complete mismatch, and 1 being a perfect match.

Relevance is based on multiple criteria, and should not be considered an absolute number. 0.5 does not mean that the match is half as relevant than 1, instead it simply means that the match is *less* relevant. Furthermore it is worth noting that, depending on how you have configured Jhaystack, a match from the same comparison strategy can in different scenarios result in a different relevance. This is simply because the order of comparison functions provided to Jhaystack matters when determining match relevance. 

When relevance is calculated the order of comparison function will always takes precedence. Secondarily relevance will be based on the score of the comparison function. And thirdly, there may be parts of the comparison function that scores values differently depending on different criteria.
