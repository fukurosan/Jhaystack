# Clustering Strategy

Clusters are like plugins that can be used for faster and more precise inexact k retrieval. Clusters are typically useful for when you either have mid to large size data sets and need to squeeze out every bit of performance that you can, or when you are in need of some form of special use case functionality. Clusters have a build-phase and must be constructed before they can be used.

Clusters can be passed options, both at build time as well as at query time.

Note that some clusters require a built index in order to function, while others do not. Remember to check the documentation of each cluster to make sure.

To configure a cluster you do the following:

```javascript
import { Jhaystack, ClusteringStrategy } from "jhaystack"

const options = {
    clustering: {
        strategy: [
            {
                id: "kmeans",
                cluster: ClusteringStrategy.KMEANS,
                options: {
                    maxRepetition: 20
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
const se = new Jhaystack(options)

//You can also build the clusters manually:
se.setClusterStrategy( [
    {
        id: "kmeans",
        cluster: ClusteringStrategy.KMEANS,
        options: {
            maxRepetition: 20
        }
    }
], true)
se.buildClusters()
```

Clusters can be queried using filters at search time. Check out the search API for more information.

It is possible to extract computed data from a cluster for example for troubleshooting or NLP purposes. The data structure for different types of clusters may be different. To extract the data you simply use the getClusterData() function:

```javascript
kmeans.getClusterData("kmeans") // -> Map<string, number[]>
```

Jhaystack comes with the following clusters built in:

> ## KMeans

KMeans will compute groups of documents based on an unsupervised k-means algorithm applied to the documentsâ€™ vectors. You can either supply the amount of groups to create, or let Jhaystack make a guesstimate. You can also specify how many cycles Jhaystack should loop through in trying to optimize the groupings. Beware of setting this to -1 since it could lead to very long cluster construction times for large datasets.

The getClusterData() function will return a map object where each key is a category and each value an array of numbers specifying the index of the document in the data source.

This strategy requires a built index.

The following options can be configured at **build time**:
 - **k** 
   - **Description**: *Number of clusters. If set to -1 the optimal number will be estimated by the algorithm.*
   - **Type**: `number`
   - **Default**: `-1`
 - **maxRepetition** 
   - **Description**: *Number of times to run the readjustment algorithm. A higher number becomes more accurate, a lower number executes faster at build time. -1 means that the algorithm will keep going until change is no longer observed.*
   - **Type**: `number`
   - **Default**: `10`

No options can be passed at **query time**

> ## Naive Bayes

Naive Bayes is a supervised probabilistic classification algorithm that can be used for text classification. Typical use cases are spam filters, sentiment analysis or categorization of texts like news articles or blog posts. Using either a provided training dataset or a training function the cluster will create a document classification index that can be used for filtering information at query time.

The getClusterData() function will return a map object where each key is a category and each value an array of numbers specifying the index of the document in the data source.

This strategy does not require a built index.

The following options can be configured at **build time**:
 - **training** 
   - **Description**: *This can either be a training set, which is an array where each inner array contains a string of text and a classification, or a function that takes an (original) object from the provided dataset as input and provides a classification as output.*
   - **Type**: `number[string, string][] | ((obj: any) => [string, string])`
   - **Default**: `undefined`
 - **field?** 
   - **Description**: *If only a specific field should be used for the analysis the property path can be provided here as a string, with each property separated with a ".".*
   - **Type**: `string`
   - **Default**: `undefined`

The following options can be configured at **query time**
 - **category?** 
   - **Description**: *If you want to simply filter by a category it can be provided here and no further computations will be made.*
   - **Type**: `string`
   - **Default**: `undefined`
 - **field?** 
   - **Description**: *If only a specific field should be used for the analysis the property path can be provided here as a string, with each property separated with a ".".*
   - **Type**: `string`
   - **Default**: `undefined`

> ## Range

Range allows you to query for ranges of values, for example numbers and dates. This cluster requires that you specify a field to be used. The index will map all values on the field, and allow you to retrieve all documents using greater than/less than operators. Beware that the cluster does not have a constant lookup time.

The getClusterData() function will return an ordered list values with their corresponding document index in the data source.

This strategy does not require a built index.

The following options can be configured at **build time**:
 - **field** 
   - **Description**: *Field that cluster should be based on formatted as a "." joined string of the property path*
   - **Type**: `string`
   - **Default**: `undefined`
 - **transformer** 
   - **Description**: *Optional transformer function that will be applied to all values*
   - **Type**: `string`
   - **Default**: `undefined`

The following options can be configured at **query time**
 - **lessThan** 
   - **Description**: *Value that should be less than*
   - **Type**: `number`
   - **Default**: `undefined`
 - **greaterThan** 
   - **Description**: *Value that should be greater than.*
   - **Type**: `number`
   - **Default**: `undefined`

## Custom Clusters

Developers can create their own clusters that can be plugged into Jhaystack, although it requires a bit of insight into the internal data structure. Check out these interfaces for how to create your own cluster class:

```javascript
/** Meta data about the index */
interface IIndexStatistics {
	numberOfDocuments: number
	numberOfTokens: number
	averageDocumentLength: number
}

/** Position of a token */
interface ITokenizerResultPositions {
	field: string
	offsetStart: number
	offsetEnd: number
	position: number
}

/** Information about a token */
interface IIndexTokenMeta {
	positions: ITokenizerResultPositions[]
	magnitude: number
}

/** Unique identifier for documents */
type DocumentID = number

/** An internal Jhaystack document */
interface Document {
	/** Unique Identifier */
	id: DocumentID
	/** The origin object */
	origin: any
	/** The index of the origin object in the origin array */
	originIndex: number
	/** All values found nested inside of the origin object, extracted using the extraction strategy */
	declarations: Declaration[]
}

/** A declared value inside of a document */
interface Declaration {
	/** The value */
	value: any
	/** The original (unprocessed) value */
	originValue: any
	/** The path inside of the Item object used to find the value */
	path: (string | number)[]
	/** The last non-numeric property in the path - I.e. any potential array index removed */
	key: string | null
	/** The score multiplier of the declaration */
	weight: number
	/** The normalized multiplier of the declaration */
	normalizedWeight: number
}

/** An indexed document. Note that token map and vector will be empty if an index has not been built */
interface IIndexDocument {
	document: Document
	tokenMap: Map<string, IIndexTokenMeta>
	vector: number[]
}

/** This is the cluster class you need to implement */
interface ICluster {
    //id property must be set in constructor, and be publically accessible
	id: string
	build: (documents: IIndexDocument[], statistics: IIndexStatistics) => void
	evaluate: (document?: IIndexDocument, options?: any) => DocumentID[]
  getData: () => any
}

/** And the constructor looks like this */
type IClusterConstructor new <T extends ICluster>(id: any, options: any): T
```
