## What is this?
Jhaystack is a JavaScript search engine.

The word Jhaystack is a play of words with "JS-Stack", and was coined because it `helps you find a needle in a JS-Stack`.

Jhaystack aims to be a library that can scale together with projects as requirements grow more complex. Every part of the library is built to be customizable as well as unit testable, with support for a variety of addons. 

## Why Jhaystack?
- Modular and customizable
- Compatible with most runtime environments
- Zero dependencies
- Addons can easily be unit tested
- Fast searches
- Simple to use
- No dedicated search backend needed
