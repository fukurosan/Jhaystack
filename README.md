## What is this?
Jhaystack is a lightweight JavaScript search engine.

The word Jhaystack is a play of words with "JS-Stack", and was coined because it `helps you find a needle in a JS-Stack`.

Jhaystack allows you to search through not just values but also objects and arrays, and fine tune your search in order to fit a variety of different use cases. Unlike most other search engines Jhaystack is not limited to evaluating strings, but can also be customized to evaluate other data types, like dates, numbers, or even regular expressions.

## Why Jhaystack?
- Modular and customizable
- Compatible with most runtime environments
- Zero dependencies
- Fast searches
- Simple to use
- No dedicated search backend needed
